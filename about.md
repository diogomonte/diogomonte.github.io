I am passionated about technology and software development. Since 2009 I have been working
in different domains and technologies while enjoying the process of traveling and discovering the world.

I have built my career in a variety of industries in different countries, working in big and small internation teams.

I enjoy collaborating with development, architecting, creativity and sharing knowledge with others. 

- I am a test-driver developer. I strongly believe writing unit tests helps on future refactoring.
- I care about coverage and code review. It helps to keep the code quality and spread knowledge between the team members.
- I like to be notified quickly when I break things. So I refer to continuous integration on this matter.
- I like to work on teams that have good connection and inspire each other to grow together.
